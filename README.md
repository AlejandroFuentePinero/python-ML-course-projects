# Machine Learning Projects
### Learning lab for ML fundamentals
A curated collection of **end-to-end machine learning projects**, each designed to demonstrate practical problem-solving, rigorous analysis, and clear communication of results.  
Projects cover the full workflow: data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and interpretation.

---

## Repository Structure

Each project folder contains:

- A **Jupyter Notebook** documenting the problem, methods, key decisions, and results  
- All **datasets** used for training and testing  
- Clear explanations of limitations, assumptions, and takeaways

## Project Catalogue

- 01_linear_regression — Predicting a continuous target from tabular data using linear regression; focus on feature scaling, trend interpretation, and error analysis.
- 02_logistic_regression — Binary classification with logistic regression; emphasis on decision thresholds, precision/recall, and ROC–AUC.
- 03_K_nearest_neighbors — KNN for classification; exploring distance metrics and the bias–variance trade-off.
- 04_decision_trees_and_random_forest — Tree-based models for non-linear decision boundaries; feature importance and overfitting control.
- 05_support_vector_machines — SVM decision boundaries; kernel tricks and margin interpretation.
- 06_K_means_clustering — Unsupervised clustering; choosing k and interpreting cluster structure.
- 07_recommender_systems — Item/user similarity and basic collaborative filtering for recommendations.
- 08_NLM — Text classification with Naive Bayes; tokenisation, vectorisation, and baseline NLP workflows.
- 09_NN_Keras_regression — Feedforward neural net for regression with Keras; architecture design and regularisation.
- 10_NN_Keras_classification — Neural network classifier; class imbalance handling and evaluation.
- 11_NN_LendingClub — Credit-risk style classification on LendingClub-like data; model evaluation from a risk perspective.

## Learning Focus

Across these projects, I apply the core principles of **supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning**, including:

- Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and scaling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand structure, patterns, and drivers  
- Model selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter optimisation  
- Performance evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1, ROC/AUC, RMSE  
- Model interpretability and communication of insights  
- Critical reasoning about algorithm behaviour and model trade-offs  

These projects emphasise not just *how* to build models, but *why* they behave as they do.
