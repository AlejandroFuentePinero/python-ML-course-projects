# Machine Learning Projects

A curated collection of **end-to-end machine learning projects**, each designed to demonstrate practical problem-solving, rigorous analysis, and clear communication of results.  
Projects cover the full workflow: data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and interpretation.

---

## Repository Structure

Each project folder contains:

- A **Jupyter Notebook** documenting the problem, methods, key decisions, and results  
- All **datasets** used for training and testing  
- Clear explanations of limitations, assumptions, and takeaways  

---

## Learning Focus

Across these projects, I apply the core principles of **supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning**, including:

- Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and scaling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand structure, patterns, and drivers  
- Model selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter optimisation  
- Performance evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1, ROC/AUC, RMSE  
- Model interpretability and communication of insights  
- Critical reasoning about algorithm behaviour and model trade-offs  

These projects emphasise not just *how* to build models, but *why* they behave as they do.

## Purpose

This repository forms a core part of my **Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio**.  
The focus is on producing clean, interpretable, and well-structured analytical work that reflects real-world workflows. Each project highlights:

- Clear problem framing  
- Strong attention to EDA and feature engineering  
- A transparent modelling process  
- Honest evaluation of model strengths and weaknesses  
- Clear communication of insights and trade-offs
