# Machine Learning Projects

This repository showcases a collection of **hands-on machine learning projects**.  
Each project demonstrates end-to-end implementation of key algorithms, emphasising data preparation, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

---

## Repository Structure
Each folder contains:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** with code, project description and motivation, visualisations, key concepts, limitations, and takeaways 
- The **dataset(s)** used for model training and testing  

---

## Learning Objectives
Through these projects, I applied the **core principles of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning**, including:

- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and scaling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualisation  
- Model training, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning  
- Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, ROC/AUC, and RMSE  
- Model interpretability, feature importance, and communication of results

## Purpose
This repository is part of my ongoing **Data Science & Machine Learning portfolio**, showcasing both conceptual understanding and applied technical skills.  
Each project reinforces not just *how* models are built — but *why* they behave the way they do, focusing on insight, evaluation, and interpretability.
