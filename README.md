# Machine Learning Fundamentals – Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a collection of **hands-on machine learning projects** completed as part of the *Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp (Udemy)*.  
Each project explores a different algorithm or workflow, focusing on practical implementation, model interpretation, and visualization.

---

Each folder includes:
- Jupyter notebook with code and explanations  
- Dataset(s) used for training/testing

---

## Learning Objectives

Across these projects, I apply the **core principles of supervised and unsupervised learning**, including:

- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and scaling  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Interpretability and communication of results
